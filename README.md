__Notice:__ We have [released](https://github.com/blog/2055-teachers-manage-your-courses-with-classroom-for-github) a web based tool for teachers. `teachers_pet` will remain availble, but we recommend teachers use [Classroom for GitHub](https://classroom.github.com) instead.

# teachers_pet [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/education/teachers_pet.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/education/teachers_pet) [![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/teachers_pet.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/rb/teachers_pet)

**WARNING: This documentation may contain unreleased changes. See [rubydoc.info/gems/teachers_pet](http://rubydoc.info/gems/teachers_pet) for the version of this README corresponding to the latest release.**

Command line tool to help teachers use GitHub in their classrooms.

## Philosophy

Each class is an 'organization' on GitHub. This allows the instructors (GitHub organization Owners) to create, push, pull, and administer all repositories. This achieves two goals:

* Instructors can push code starter code to all students
* Instructors can easily browse/pull student code at any time during the assignment to assist in questions, check on progress

Each student is given a team in the organization. The team name is the same as the student's GitHub username.
